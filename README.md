# Handwritten Character Recognition System

## Overview

This project implements a **Handwritten Character Recognition** system using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques. The system is capable of recognizing individual handwritten characters (alphabets) and can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences. The core model leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to identify and classify characters with high accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Character Recognition**: The model can recognize individual characters (A-Z, a-z).
- **Word Recognition (Optional Extension)**: The system can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences by combining character predictions.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), ensuring high accuracy and robustness.
- **Dataset**: The system uses publicly available datasets like **EMNIST (Extended MNIST)** or **HWDB (Handwriting Database)** for training.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x**: This project is developed using Python 3.x.
2. **Libraries**: The project requires the following libraries for machine learning and image processing:
   - `tensorflow` (or `keras`)
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `opencv-python`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `pandas`

You can install all required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**:

```
tensorflow==2.7.0
numpy==1.21.2
matplotlib==3.4.3
opencv-python==4.5.3.56
scikit-learn==0.24.2
pandas==1.3.3
```

## Usage

### 1. Load Pre-trained Model

The system can use a pre-trained model to recognize handwritten characters. If you are using a pre-trained model, you can load it as follows:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the pre-trained model
model = load_model('path_to_model/character_recognition_model.h5')
```

### 2. Preprocess Image Input

Before feeding the image into the model, preprocess the image by converting it to grayscale, resizing it, and normalizing it:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load image and convert to grayscale
    image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    
    # Resize image to 28x28 (assuming model trained with MNIST size)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (28, 28))
    
    # Normalize pixel values to range [0, 1]
    image = image.astype('float32') / 255.0
    
    # Reshape for model input (batch_size, height, width, channels)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=-1)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    
    return image
```

### 3. Predict Handwritten Character

Once the image is preprocessed, you can make a prediction:

```python
# Preprocess the image
processed_image = preprocess_image('path_to_image.png')

# Predict the character
prediction = model.predict(processed_image)
predicted_char = np.argmax(prediction)

print(f"Predicted Character: {chr(predicted_char + 65)}")  # Convert label to character (A=0, B=1, ...)
```

---

## Model Training

### 1. Dataset

For character recognition, we use a dataset like **EMNIST** or **HWDB** which contains handwritten characters. These datasets can be loaded using the following:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import emnist

# Load EMNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = emnist.load_data()
```

### 2. Preprocessing the Data

Ensure the input data is normalized and reshaped for the CNN:

```python
# Normalize images to [0, 1] range
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Reshape for CNN (batch_size, height, width, channels)
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
```

### 3. Building the CNN Model

We use a CNN architecture to train the model. Here's an example architecture using TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Build the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(26, activation='softmax')  # 26 classes for A-Z
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### 4. Train the Model

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)
model.save('character_recognition_model.h5')
```

---

## Evaluation

After training the model, evaluate its performance using test data:

```python
# Evaluate the model on test data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%")
```
